Was looking at ASICS Novablast 3/4, Kayano 30, Cumulus 25. Any of these options for heavy beginner runners for long runs viable? Hit me up! :)\",\n          \"Hello everyone,\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I sought recommendations for an  [**8 weeks training program**](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyrox/comments/1hfkcz1/help_needed_free_8_weeks_training_plan_for_hyrox/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and finally committed to [**this**](https://ugc.production.linktr.ee/7e7f551f-02b2-40f2-89dc-2fcd2d998f85_aaa716-c5a72be332644e93998a6c970c9ae141.pdf) one. However, after just a couple of days, I've realized that the program places a significantly higher load on my lower body than I'm accustomed to, making it quite taxing.\\n\\nOn the nutrition front, I\\u2019m doing fairly well, ensuring I stay fueled for recovery. That said, I\\u2019m curious about how others who transitioned to a similar running-heavy program managed the adjustment. Specifically:\\n\\n* How long did it take your body to adapt to the increased running volume?\\n* Did you make any specific adjustments (scaling, recovery practices, etc.) that helped ease the process?\\n\\nFor context, I\\u2019m 36M, 5\\u201910\\\", 77kgs. I\\u2019m consistent with functional workouts but have historically done minimal running\\u2014about 5-6 km per week, mostly on a treadmill. I plan to stick with the program but will scale certain aspects if needed to ensure sustainability.\\n\\nEdit:  \\nCurrent stats:  \\n1RM DL: 150kgs  \\n1RM Squat: 120kgs  \\nBench: 75kgs(I have a long term shoulder injury)  \\nRun: 5kms in 33mins\\n\\nWould love to hear your insights and experiences!

They are for my first marathon and should not be tooo expensive.. I just blasted my budget by getting an Apple Watch and HR chest strap so any recs for would be greatly appreciated. Was looking at ASICS Novablast 3/4, Kayano 30, Cumulus 25. Any of these options for heavy beginner runners for long runs viable? Hit me up! :)\",\n          \"Hello everyone,\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I sought recommendations for an  [**8 weeks training program**](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyrox/comments/1hfkcz1/help_needed_free_8_weeks_training_plan_for_hyrox/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and finally committed to [**this**](https://ugc.production.linktr.ee/7e7f551f-02b2-40f2-89dc-2fcd2d998f85_aaa716-c5a72be332644e93998a6c970c9ae141.pdf) one. However, after just a couple of days, I've realized that the program places a significantly higher load on my lower body than I'm accustomed to, making it quite taxing.\\n\\nOn the nutrition front, I\\u2019m doing fairly well, ensuring I stay fueled for recovery. That said, I\\u2019m curious about how others who transitioned to a similar running-heavy program managed the adjustment. Specifically:\\n\\n* How long did it take your body to adapt to the increased running volume?\\n* Did you make any specific adjustments (scaling, recovery practices, etc.) that helped ease the process?\\n\\nFor context, I\\u2019m 36M, 5\\u201910\\\", 77kgs. I\\u2019m consistent with functional workouts but have historically done minimal running\\u2014about 5-6 km per week, mostly on a treadmill. I plan to stick with the program but will scale certain aspects if needed to ensure sustainability.\\n\\nEdit:  \\nCurrent stats:  \\n1RM DL: 150kgs  \\n1RM Squat: 120kgs  \\nBench: 75kgs(I have a long term shoulder injury)  \\nRun: 5kms in 33mins\\n\\nWould love to hear your insights and experiences!

They are for my first marathon and should not be tooo expensive.. I just blasted my budget by getting an Apple Watch and HR chest strap so any recs for would be greatly appreciated. Was looking at ASICS Novablast 3/4, Kayano 30, Cumulus 25. Any of these options for heavy beginner runners for long runs viable? Hit me up! :)\",\n          \"Hello everyone,\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I sought recommendations for an  [**8 weeks training program**](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyrox/comments/1hfkcz1/help_needed_free_8_weeks_training_plan_for_hyrox/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and finally committed to [**this**](https://ugc.production.linktr.ee/7e7f551f-02b2-40f2-89dc-2fcd2d998f85_aaa716-c5a72be332644e93998a6c970c9ae141.pdf) one. However, after just a couple of days, I've realized that the program places a significantly higher load on my lower body than I'm accustomed to, making it quite taxing.\\n\\nOn the nutrition front, I\\u2019m doing fairly well, ensuring I stay fueled for recovery. That said, I\\u2019m curious about how others who transitioned to a similar running-heavy program managed the adjustment. Specifically:\\n\\n* How long did it take your body to adapt to the increased running volume?\\n* Did you make any specific adjustments (scaling, recovery practices, etc.) that helped ease the process?\\n\\nFor context, I\\u2019m 36M, 5\\u201910\\\", 77kgs. I\\u2019m consistent with functional workouts but have historically done minimal running\\u2014about 5-6 km per week, mostly on a treadmill. I plan to stick with the program but will scale certain aspects if needed to ensure sustainability.\\n\\nEdit:  \\nCurrent stats:  \\n1RM DL: 150kgs  \\n1RM Squat: 120kgs  \\nBench: 75kgs(I have a long term shoulder injury)  \\nRun: 5kms in 33mins\\n\\nWould love to hear your insights and experiences!

Was looking at ASICS Novablast 3/4, Kayano 30, Cumulus 25. Any of these options for heavy beginner runners for long runs viable? Hit me up! :)\",\n          \"Hello everyone,\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I sought recommendations for an  [**8 weeks training program**](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyrox/comments/1hfkcz1/help_needed_free_8_weeks_training_plan_for_hyrox/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and finally committed to [**this**](https://ugc.production.linktr.ee/7e7f551f-02b2-40f2-89dc-2fcd2d998f85_aaa716-c5a72be332644e93998a6c970c9ae141.pdf) one. However, after just a couple of days, I've realized that the program places a significantly higher load on my lower body than I'm accustomed to, making it quite taxing.\\n\\nOn the nutrition front, I\\u2019m doing fairly well, ensuring I stay fueled for recovery. That said, I\\u2019m curious about how others who transitioned to a similar running-heavy program managed the adjustment. Specifically:\\n\\n* How long did it take your body to adapt to the increased running volume?\\n* Did you make any specific adjustments (scaling, recovery practices, etc.) that helped ease the process?\\n\\nFor context, I\\u2019m 36M, 5\\u201910\\\", 77kgs. I\\u2019m consistent with functional workouts but have historically done minimal running\\u2014about 5-6 km per week, mostly on a treadmill. I plan to stick with the program but will scale certain aspects if needed to ensure sustainability.\\n\\nEdit:  \\nCurrent stats:  \\n1RM DL: 150kgs  \\n1RM Squat: 120kgs  \\nBench: 75kgs(I have a long term shoulder injury)  \\nRun: 5kms in 33mins\\n\\nWould love to hear your insights and experiences!

The user is asking me to act as an expert analyzing fitness training discussions, specifically looking for the most common hybrid training discussions. They provided a list of topics and questions from a live session, and they want me to summarize the common concerns and generate related questions about hybrid training, filtering out any irrelevant information.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I should understand what hybrid training is. From what I know, hybrid training combines different types of exercises or training methods to enhance overall fitness. It could involve mixing strength training with endurance exercises, or using a combination of indoor and outdoor workouts, for example.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at the provided topics and questions, I see a variety of subjects. Some are about specific events like the HYROX Elite 15 and World Championships in Nice 2024, others are about personal training issues like hitting a deka PR, Achilles/calf problems, getting scammed by a Facebook group, mailbox info for Middle East, sled pulling strength, product feedback, adding days to Atlanta or Miami, and results.\n",
            "\n",

This seems to be about a specific event, possibly a race or competition, but I'm not sure if it's directly related to hybrid training. It might be more about a specific type of event rather than the training methods used.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, the question about 3 reasons why someone isn't hitting a deka PR. A deka PR could refer to a decathlon personal record, which is a combination of 10 events. This seems relevant because it's about combining various athletic events, which is a form of hybrid training.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next point is about Achilles/calf problems from running. This is more about injury prevention and running, which is a specific aspect of training but not necessarily about hybrid methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, there's a mention of Thena, which I'm not sure about. It could be a typo or a specific product or program. Without more context, it's hard to say if it's related to hybrid training.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next point is about getting scammed by a private Facebook group. This seems unrelated to training methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hyrox Middle East mailbox likely refers to contact information or updates for a specific program, but again, not directly about hybrid training.\n",
            "\n",
            "How strong is an 80 kg non-pro woman sled pulling 135 kg? This is about strength assessment, which is a specific aspect of training but not necessarily about combining different methods.\n",

            "3. How strong is a non-pro woman sled pulling? This is about strength training, which could be part of a hybrid approach that includes both strength and endurance.\n",
            "4. Found these and love them – if these are hybrid training tools or methods, this is relevant.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other topics seem less related. The event and competition topics are more about specific competitions rather than the training methods. The scam and scheduling topics are unrelated.\n",
